Huh?\n\nIf there's a new way, I'll be the first in line\nBut it better work this time\n\nWhat do you mean I \"hurt your feelings?\"\nI didn't know you had any feelings\nWhat do you mean I \"ain't kind?\"\nI'm just not your kind\nWhat do you mean I \"couldn't be the president\nOf the United States of America?\"\nTell me something\nIt's still \"we the people,\" right?\n\nIf there's a new way, I'll be the first in line\nBut it better work this time\n\nCan you put a price on peace?\n\nPeace, peace sells\nPeace, peace sells!\n\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\n\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\nPeace sells, but who's buyin'?\n\nNo, no-no-no-no\nPeace sells\n(Peace sells)\nPeace sells!"
